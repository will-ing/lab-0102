      <p>
      I grew up in a big military home both parents were in navy so as kids we got to travel alot to many different places.
      I then graduated high school and shipped off to paris island for boot camp. My Mos (job) was a machine gunner so 
      after bootcamp i went to SOI(school of infrantry) in camp gieger North Carolina where i learned how to operate and employ machine guns in battle.
      I then latter would go on to do many different types of deployments As well as many different types of schools.
